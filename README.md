The Fuel Tracker App is a user-friendly tool that allows individuals to keep track of their visits to gas stations. The app offers an editable field for the user to enter the name of the gas station, date of visit, fuel type (Gasoline or Diesel), amount in liters, and price per liter in dollars. Additionally, the app calculates the fuel cost in dollars and the carbon footprint in kg CO2 for each visit and provides a summary of the total fuel cost and carbon footprint below the list of visits. The app also offers features to add, view, edit, and delete gas station visits. With this app, users can effectively manage their gas station records and also gain insight into their carbon footprint.
